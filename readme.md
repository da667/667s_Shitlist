667's shitlist

An Open-Source Malware Intelligence collection with additional data and context where availble.

What this list is:
-A collection of IP addresses, domains, sha256 hashes and other neat things here and there that I believe are worth mentioning collected through open sources.
-A labor of love.
-NOT GARANTEED IN ANY WAY. There may be days where I simply don't have the time to update the list. It is what it is, and I simply do my best.
-Not possible without other researchers doing the bulk of the work. I just gather it into one place for redistribution and add some contextual data.

What this list is not:
-An official Cisco or TALOS product. Cisco and its properties are in no way responsible for the contents of this blacklist and will not be held responsible for the contents of this list.
-If you take issue with any of the contents of this list, wish to be removed from this list, etc., feel free to submit an issue via github or otherwise get a hold of me. CISCO CANNOT AND WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH THIS BLACKLIST.

For best results:
-Most of the items here are evil until proven innocent. That includes a lot of websites hosting stage 2 payloads for ransomware and other things. Malware happens to change very rapidly these days, shifting like sand in a desert. However, I'm very much a "kill with fire and never look back" kinda security person; if it's been compromised and used for malicious intent once, it'll likely be abused again. 
-If you like to err on the side of user accessibility, assume that all items entered on a given day are "evil" for a period of at least 7 days, unless otherwise remediated, removed, or fixed within that period of time.

Other things:
-The list is released under the MIT license. Cisco (and by extension, me) is not responsible for how you consume this data in any way, or if the list results in fiery post taco-bell network diarrhea.
